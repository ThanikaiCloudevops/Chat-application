# Yes, that's correct! If you create the ansible (or ansibledevopsint) user, give it the proper SSH key configuration, and add it to the sudo group,
it should allow Jenkins to connect to the server using that user.

# You're asking why the connection works when you use root as the username in Jenkins, but not when you use ansibledevopsint or any non-root user

INSTEAD WE CAN DO ONE SOLUTION !!!
 # Add User name and password for Ansible
-> sudo useradd ansible
-> sudo passwd ansible

# Set Up SSH Key-Based Authentication for ansible
-> sudo mkdir -p /home/ansible/.ssh
-> sudo chmod 700 /home/ansible/.ssh
-> sudo chown ansible:ansible /home/ansible/.ssh
#  Add the ansible User to the sudo Group
-> sudo usermod -aG sudo ansible
# Verify sudo Access
-> sudo -u ansible sudo ls /root
