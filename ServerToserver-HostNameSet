          Create key in jenkins use Commands -> { ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -f ./my_custom_keyName }
          And you login into ansible server cd .ssh/authorized_key add you created customkey NOTE: publickey you have to paste
          and come to jenkins server use command
                          ssh admin@192.138.72.63 it will login into that server via ssh
