Install the Remote SSH Extension
If you haven’t already, download and install VSCode for your OS from here.

You can then search for the extension “Remote-SSH” in the VSCode marketplace.

Once Installed, you should see a new Status bar item at the far left.

The status item can be used to quickly open the Remote SSH settings. Click on the status item.
