# Creating Server and install ansible for insternal purpose for a devops 
i Created Sevrer in debain and i login into debain server using commands called
[ssh -i KeyName.pem admin@ip-address ]

Install Python3 using commands
{This is installastion is the best practice of ansible installing in the server for devops internal}
before that i have went to /home/admin

-> sudo apt update
-> sudo apt install -u python3.9
-> sudo apt install python3-pip
-> python3 --version {check python version}
use pip -help to check whether pip is installed or not
Next step create virtual env for Ansible server 

To install pip virtual env commands 
- > sudo apt install python3.11-venv
-> or virtualenv (NameOfEnv)
-> python3.11 -m  venv (NameOfEnv)
# Use to activate the commaand 
-> source ansible(NameOfEnv)/bin/activate
# If you want to deactivate means simple use commands
-> deacttivate
# And install Ansible Package Now 
-> pip install ansible
(Check ansible Version)
-> ansible --version
# And we need to install Ansible-galaxy
use -> ansible-galaxy --version 
# And use commands -> ansible-galaxy list
There will show two type
      -> ansible galaxy collection
      -> ansible galaxy role








#### Reason :  For Using Ansible Via python security purpose and using for multi purpose like patching managing 
automation workloads and if other devops engineer cant control the ansible only we i need to activate the 
python env files
